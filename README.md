# rpi5_ros2_notes
See rpi5_bash_history_humble_build_done for .bash_history of my rpi5  
The ros2 build starts after:  
`docker system prune -f`  
with:  
`sudo apt update && sudo apt install locales`  

I estimate 3-4 hours to build it all.  
I will update the bash history with a cleaned up version that blends all of my incremental changes into one initial change that should cause the build to work in 1-3 tires :)
